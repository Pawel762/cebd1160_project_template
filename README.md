## Research Question

What are the two wine properties with the greatest corelation?
Is this corelation same across all regions?

### Abstract

4 sentence longer explanation about your research question. Include:
The wine dataset is composed of 13 different caracteristics. The wines in this dataset are from 3 different regions.
Some of the properties are known by the general public, others are chemicals that most never heard. I wanted to see how the properties intercted together which led me to ask what are the two componanents with the strongest corelation and is this corelation equivalent regardless of which region the wine is from.
- opportunity (what data do we have)
- challenge (what is the "problem" we could solve with this dataset)
- action (how will we try to solve this problem/answer this question)
- resolution (what did we end up producing)

### Introduction

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about the dataset. Can copy from elsewhere, but cite the source (i.e. at least link, and explicitly say if it's copied from elsewhere).

### Methods

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about how you decided to approach solving it. Include:

- pseudocode for this method (either created by you or cited from somewhere else)
- why you chose this method

### Results

Brief (2 paragraph) description about your results. Include:

- At least 1 figure
- At least 1 "value" that summarizes either your data or the "performance" of your method
- A short explanation of both of the above

### Discussion
Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about what you did. Include:

- interpretation of whether your method "solved" the problem
- suggested next step that could make it better.

### References
